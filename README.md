# ParkingMeter
ðŸš— Comprehensive implementation of a parking meter.  

The parking meter calculates the parking fee based on a specific pricing scheme. 

* A customer must be allowed to enter number of hours of parking and money paid. 
* The meter must return the appropriate change with as few coins as possible, if any. 
* If the customer has provided insufficient funds, the parking meter shows how much money is still missing - suggesting how it can be provided with a minimum number of coins.
